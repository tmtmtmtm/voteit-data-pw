# The MPâ€™s votes count towards a weighted average where the most important
# votes get 50 points, less important votes get 10 points, and less
# important votes for which the MP was absent get 2 points. In important
# votes the MP gets awarded the full 50 points for voting the same as the
# policy, no points for voting against the policy, and 25 points for not
# voting. In less important votes, the MP gets 10 points for voting with
# the policy, no points for voting against, and 1 (out of 2) if absent.
